# Optimizing LLaVA: Measuring Mistral Against LLaMA for Visual Instruction Tuning

## Introduction

In the ever-expanding universe of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have quickly moved from the shadows into the spotlight, transforming how we interact with technology. These models have mastered not just the art of conversation but have also stepped into the realm of understanding and generating visual content. Imagine AI that not only chats with you but can also interpret and create images based on your discussions. That's where our project steps in, optimizing the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA) by switching its core from LLaMA to Mistral, achieving groundbreaking efficiency without sacrificing performance.
